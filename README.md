# Shape Calculator Technical Test

We have provided you with a partly completed solution to accomplish the task of being able to calculate triangle coordinates based off of a grid value and a grid value based off of coordinates.

The Unit tests inside the project are already complete, but they are failing due to the missing implementation, these will all need to pass before the task can be seen as completed.

The architecture in the solution is a rough guide to help you organise the implementation, feel free to deviate away from this if you feel a better way to accomplish the task at hand.

You are expected to clone the repository onto your local machine, complete the solution locally and then create a new repository on your own GitHub account, useful documents can be found below with some tips on how to accomplish this and other things.

The two requirements for the task are below.

Geometric layouts

1.A - The task, calculate the triangle coordinates for an image with right triangles such that for a given
row (A-F) and column (1-12) you can produce any of the triangles in the layout below:

Each non-hypotenuse side of the triangle is as follows:

1.B - Lastly, given the vertex coordinates, calculate the row and column for the triangle:
